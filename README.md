PUBG Weapon Analysis

Abstract 

The dataset contains details about the weapon attributes of PUBG Mobile games, which is a popular shooting type game all over the world. 
The players' goal in one game is to survive on a land by picking up supplies(weapons, bullets,etc.) and fighting for each other. 
I am interested about the variety of weapons' attributes such as weapon type, bullet speed, range, etc.This could help the players to choose the appropriate weapons when fighting.

The dataset is public available (Source:https://www.kaggle.com/aadhavvignesh/pubg-weapon-stats).

Data Included: 

Weapon Name, Weapon Type, Bullet Type, Damage, Magazine Capacity, Range, Bullet Speed, Rate of Fire, Shots to Kill(Chest), Shots to Kill(Head).

My Interesting Finding:
The OLS model's result verified that there is a postively correlated relationship between the weapon's bullet speed and it's range.
